## 📚 About The Project

**This project is co-written by Joseph L. & Lumi K.**

`miniRT` is a mini ray tracing project implemented in C. It focuses on essential operations for 3D graphics processing, providing the necessary tools to perform calculations fundamental to rendering 3D graphics. The project aims to facilitate the development and understanding of 3D rendering techniques.

### Features
- Basic operations for handling 3D graphics.
- Implementation in C for performance and efficiency.
- Fundamental tools for vector and tuple manipulations essential in graphics processing.

## 🏁 Getting Started

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/lkilpela/miniRT.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd miniRT`
3. Compile the project: `make`

## 🚀 Running the Application
After building the project, you can run the application using:
```
./miniRT scene/scene_name.rt
```
Replace scene_name.rt with the name of the scene file you want to run.

### 🧑‍💻 Peer Evaluations (3/3)

Here are some of the comments received during the peer evaluation of the `minirt` project:

> **Peer 1**: "Great work! Lumi and Joseph explained everything well and went through it slowly so I could understand. They showed great examples from the project. Spheres, planes etc. Very good job!"

> **Peer 2**: "Great project and very clean and neat looking code! Lumi and Joseph explained how everything worked and were helpful with making the evaluation smooth. The structure of the project looks really good. The program itself was unfortunately on this computer a bit slow which made the evaluation a bit slower and discourages a lot of tests but we still looked at all the mandatory examples and plenty more. Everything clearly works as intended, nice work! Thanks for a nice eval! :)"

> **Peer 3**: "Well done project - passed all tests. Would recommend silencing some Makefile msgs as well as limiting certain input in the scenefile. You guys put a lot of work and dedication into this, which is apparent. Well done passing this ring (of fire). ;)"
